A research and thesis driven investment company focusing on the Blockchain sector and the Horn of Africa. We support genuine use cases of Blockchain technology, especially for developing countries, and projects that demonstrate sound token economics with proven demand and sources of value accrual. We have a keen interest in the store of value feature for bitcoin, public blockchains that could potentially support large networks and a variety of dApps with use cases that affect the average citizen and oracle networks that will power data, computation and trustless processes in the future.
