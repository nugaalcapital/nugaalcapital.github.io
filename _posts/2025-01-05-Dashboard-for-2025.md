This dashboard presents some key graphs we will be keeping an eye on in the next few months.

- DXY weakening will be positive for risk assets
- Will be interesting to see if Bitcoin somewhat follows a similar path to when Trump first took office
- TGA run down should be positive for liquidity
- With financial loosening, it will be interesting to observe if retail money market funds divert to risk on.
